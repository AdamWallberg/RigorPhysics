# Rigor Physics
Verlet integration physics engine I made for a university course.

<b>Note: No longer in development! I made this public if anyone wants to look at it for reference.</b>

### Supported features
* Verlet physics integration particles
* Planes
* Point masses (without rotation)
* Convex hull generation from point masses
* Fixed distance constraints
* Spring constraints
* Particle-plane constraints
* Particle-hull constraints
* Hull-plane constraints
* Hull-Hull constraints
